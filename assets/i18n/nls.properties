tutorialGuide=BeardBlaster is a game of having the longest beard to rule them all. You grow your beard by winning games, and get it cut when you lose. Create a game and share the code with a challenger to start playing. \n\nIn the game you go through a preparation phase where you select elements to create a spell to cast upon yourself, to attack your foe, or both depending on the combination. \n\nThere are three elements to choose from: \n- Fire for damage \n- Ice for shielding \n- Nature for healing your wounds \n\nChoose three of the same element for the most powerful spells. \n\nThe game is not over until one wizard falls... May the longest beard prevail.
